I'm running the 2023 New York City Marathon (my first!) in memory of my mom — Catherine Harrington-Droukas — and to support the groundbreaking work Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is doing to advance treatments for people battling cancer.

Dana-Farber focuses exclusively on cancer and related diseases, and partners with two of the world's highest-ranked hospitals to provide care for adult and pediatric patients. Dana-Farber has engaged in over 70 years of research discovery and innovation that have revolutionized cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Together, **we've raised over $5,500 for Dana-Farber**. I'm incredibly grateful for the support of my friends and family — your support means the world to me.
