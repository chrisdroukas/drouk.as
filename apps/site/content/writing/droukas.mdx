For a long time, I've wanted to build something of my own. Over the last several years, I've gone through many iterations of personal sites,

I've open-sourced this site — https://drouk.as/ — in the interest of showing designers and technologists how to effectively use cutting-edge frontend technologies. Everything I've learned has been by observing others, and I feel that providing examples of my own will benefit the community as well.

What's included in [this repository](https://github.com/chrisdroukas/drouk.as):

- React on Typescript
- Next.js 13 with App Directory
- API routes
- Storybook 7
- Vite
- Shadcn UI
- Contentlayer
- Turborepo
- Automated deployment and preview with Vercel
- Automated dependency management with Renovate

Let's explore a bit.
