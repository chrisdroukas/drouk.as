I'm running the 2023 New York City Marathon (my first!) in memory of my mom, and to support the groundbreaking work Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is doing to advance treatments for people battling cancer.

If you'd like to support my run, visit [my Dana-Farber fundraising page](http://danafarber.jimmyfund.org/goto/droukas-2023) for more information.
